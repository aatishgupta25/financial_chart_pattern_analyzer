The Hammer candlestick is a bullish reversal pattern that forms at the bottom of a downtrend. It has a small body (either red or green) and a long lower shadow that is typically at least twice the length of the body, with little to no upper shadow. The long lower shadow suggests that sellers pushed prices down during the session, but strong buying pressure ultimately brought prices back up towards the open. This indicates a potential rejection of lower prices and a possible shift in momentum to the upside.

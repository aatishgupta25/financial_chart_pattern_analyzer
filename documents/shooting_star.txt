The Shooting Star candlestick is a bearish reversal pattern that forms at the top of an uptrend. It has a small body (either red or green) near the bottom of the candle, a long upper shadow that is at least twice the length of the body, and little to no lower shadow. The long upper shadow suggests that buyers pushed prices up during the session, but strong selling pressure ultimately pushed prices back down towards the open. This indicates a potential rejection of higher prices and a possible shift in momentum to the downside.

A Doji candlestick is characterized by a very small or non-existent body, meaning the open and close prices are virtually identical. Its appearance often resembles a cross or plus sign, as the shadows (wicks) extend from the center. A Doji typically signals indecision in the market, indicating that neither buyers nor sellers are in control. It suggests a balance between supply and demand and can precede a reversal if it forms after a significant uptrend or downtrend. It implies a moment of market equilibrium or uncertainty.

The Bullish Engulfing pattern is a strong two-candlestick bullish reversal pattern that appears after a downtrend. It consists of a small bearish (red) candlestick on the first day, followed by a larger bullish (green) candlestick on the second day that completely "engulfs" or covers the body of the first candle. The second candle's open price is lower than the first candle's close, and its close price is higher than the first candle's open. This powerful buying action signals a strong shift in market sentiment from selling pressure to buying pressure.
